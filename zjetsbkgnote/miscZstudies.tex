This is run for 2M MC events and normalised to crossection. This is MG5aMC@NLO+pythia8 at 8TeV. This is the process that includes the EW diagrams such that interference is calculated. I'm currently re-running a sample with Strong production and EW production to show effect of interference. Eta 15/07/2016.

If required I can run at 13TeV comparing distributions in our preselection, VBF and Boosted regions with and without EW and with and without interference but no data. Eta 21/07/2016

In progress.
